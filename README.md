This library implements a Trident state on top of Redis. It supports non-transactional, transactional, and opaque state types. Available on clojars: https://clojars.org/storm.trident.redis/trident-redis

It follows trident-memcached library (https://github.com/nathanmarz/trident-memcached) as a template.
